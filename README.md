Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! With nearly a decade of diverse operational experience spanning various industries, I've developed a passion for streamlining systems and processes to not only boost productivity but also foster a culture of engaged employees. My journey recently led me to Epic Games, where I harnessed the power of my master's degree in organizational psychology, coupled with my expertise in strategic problem-solving, Airtable, Google Sheets, Greenhouse ATS, and Workday, to provide invaluable support to the recruiting team.

You might be wondering, "Why the transition to data analysis?" The answer lies in a revelation I experienced while delving into Airtable: a profound love for manipulating data. Though always inherently curious about data and its potential to unveil hidden insights, I lacked the necessary tools to fully unleash this passion. However, a surprising twist in my career trajectory prompted me to fully dedicate myself to mastering SQL, reinforcing my knowledge of Tableau, statistics, and Excel, and embracing the thrilling world of data analysis.
